## Microgreens

## Purpose
This microgreens project is built with the MERN Stack. 
The objective of this application is to provide a method to store and managedata for microgreens in order to improve the speed and ease that microgreens can be grown.
This project will be a success if:
1. it allows me to grow microgreens with less effort by reducing the administrative overhead
2. it allows me to discern, based on the collected data, the most effective variables (ie, amount of water, frequency of water, time in black out, weighted or not weighted, yield) for growing microgreens.

## What Are Microgreens
Microgreens are vegitables or herbs that are harvested when the plant is still very young. The plant is harvested usually within 7-14 days after planting, although growing times varies on a multitude of factors.
